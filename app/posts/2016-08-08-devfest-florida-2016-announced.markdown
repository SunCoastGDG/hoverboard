<a href="https://devfestflorida.org">DevFest Florida 2016</a> is the first combined DevFest being organized by three Google Developer Groups
in the central Florida area: Space Coast, Central Florida, and Sun Coast. These GDG chapters support the Orlando, Tampa, and Melbourne areas
of central Florida. We're looking forward to bringing great Google technology content to you, the developers that support and make up our
groups. We're also looking forward to hosting anyone from out of town that wants to enjoy some really nice November weather while learning
about Google technology. This is going to be the BIGGEST Google Developers event in Florida this year!

DevFest Florida 2016 is going to take place on November 5th, 2016 at a venue TBA in the Orlando area.
DevFest Florida is going to be focused on Android & Web technologies! It will also offer a networking mixer event for attendees to meet
the speakers and to provide great networking opportunities for all professionals and students.
It will be a great way to get to know your Google tech neighbors.

In most parts of the country, November weather is lousy. Before the holidays are upon us, pack a bag and join us for some fantastic
weather and even better technical content! While you're here enjoy some great food, drink, and time on the beach. Not a lot of tech
conferences can offer you all of that.
