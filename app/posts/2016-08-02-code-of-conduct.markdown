GDG Sun Coast, GDG Central Florida, and GDG Space Coast all pride themselves on being open, respectful, and inclusive communities.
That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at GDG meetings OR DevFest Florida 2016. Because we know that it’s not obvious to everyone,
here’s a reminder of the things we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size,
showing porn in public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with someone after they’ve asked you to stop. Continuous
jerky behavior may result in getting expelled from the meeting, DevFest, or GDG Chapter.

If someone is bothering you, please tell the DevFest Florida organizers immediately and they will take care of it.
We want to maintain DevFest Florida's awesomeness for everyone!
