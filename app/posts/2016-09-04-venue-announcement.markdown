# **Venue Confirmation announcement**

Hey folks,

First off, we want to thank you for your interest in [DevFest Florida](https://devfestflorida.org). This being our first year, we need to
put in extra effort to drum up interest in the event. To that end, we’ve got some great things planned for you! One of those is the venue.

### We are excited to announce that we've selected the [**Sheraton Lake Buena Vista**](http://www.sheratonlakebuenavistaresort.com/) as the venue! 

The Sheraton Lake Buena Vista does offer onsite car rentals, the 
[Top of the Palms Spa](http://www.sheratonlakebuenavistaresort.com/top-palms-spa), and two climate controlled pools with a 79 foot 
water slide.

The venue is just off of Walt Disney World property. It is a 20 minute walk (10 minute drive) to 
[Disney Springs](http://www.disneysprings.com/). In addition to having great conference facilities, it’s centrally located near a bunch of
attractions. We mentioned [Walt Disney World](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/) being just around the corner, but you will also be close
to the [Orlando Premium Outlets](http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/orlando-vineland), the restaurants and nightlife of 
[International Drive](http://www.internationaldriveorlando.com/) including the [Orlando Eye](https://www.officialorlandoeye.com/), and
[Universal Studios theme park](https://www.universalorlando.com/Theme-Parks/World-Class-Theme-Parks.aspx).

We think this is going to be a great venue to host some amazing speakers and great content that you’re going to enjoy. We also think it’s
a great place to bring family along and keep them occupied while you’re enjoying DevFest Florida on November 5th.

We’re looking forward to seeing you all real soon!
