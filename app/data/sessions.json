Angular 2 provides a great starting point for this, but you still need to handle Authentication, database, back-end servers, and quality UI components. AngularFire2 makes the Authentication easy. It provides a real-time, managed database. This means no servers to setup! Angular2-Polymer gives you easy access to the huge library of standards-based Polymer Web Components. This includes Material Design components, Flexbox Layouts, data grids, and Google components like Google Maps.",

Now, with Android 7.0, we are getting multiple windows in standard Android... and in the new Android-on-ChromeOS environment. This class will explore how to support multi-window modes in your Android applications, with particular emphasis on the split-screen mode for phones and tablets. We will look at how your app will behave in these environments without any changes and how you can make minor tweaks to improve your results. We will also examine what quirks will be seen with multi-window mode and what sorts of UX decisions you will need to make as a result. Finally, we will see how you can start testing your app in these modes, to begin making tactical changes and run experiments for longer-term strategic choices.",

They’re about making web apps do everything native apps can do without rewriting your entire codebase for different platforms.<br><br>In this talk you’ll learn how to build progressive web apps and decide why you might or might not want to.",

More recently, with support for unit testing (introduced in Android Studio 1.2) and Espresso, the tooling for testing Android applications has improved. Although we now have good testing tools available, many Android apps are structured in a way that makes it difficult for those apps to take advantage of these newer testing tools. This talk is about how to use dependency injection (with Dagger), MVP, and build flavors to write testable Android applications that make the most of Espresso and Android Studio's unit testing support.",
