We would like to thank Traversoft for being our Diamond Sponsor!! Traversoft is a mobile development consulting services company. It’s run by Mike Traverso. Mike started his career working on Wall Street and has 14+ years of professional experience developing backend and frontend solutions. In 2011, he started focusing on developing mobile apps & games.


Since focusing on mobile app development, Mike & Traversoft have implemented mobile solutions for various companies. Most notably, Mike has developed the Hillary 2016 Android app, enterprise iOS apps for the New York Yankees and their Front Office & Scouts, games & puzzles for the Ringling Bros Circus Android app and the Twitter Flight 2015 Conference apps for iOS & Android.

Traversoft takes the time to understand client’s needs. “Understanding your client’s business helps you understand what they’re looking to achieve with their mobile footprint allowing you to deliver the mobile experience they want. That isn’t always the app they ask for.”, says Mike. Traversoft can help with the entire process from UI/UX design through app store deployment or can help your business work on a feature to really make your mobile apps stand out in a crowded marketplace.
